# This repository
This is where I'll post the code for my renderer developed on the Physically Based Rendering class, offered by professor PhD Christian Azambuja Pagot at Universidade Federal da Para√≠ba, Brazil. This project will start as a Raytracer and evolve into a Path Tracer as the class progresses.

# Commit Log
1. Renderer engine to output images.
2. Added the vec3 class.
3. Added raytracing and a simple camera.
4. Added a simple sphere.

# References
Although the professor has offered a template to be used throught this class, I'll be creating a Raytracer/Path Tracer from scratch following the three mini books written by Peter Shirley:
* Ray Tracing In One Weekend
* Ray Tracing The Next Weekend
* Ray Tracing The Rest Of Your Life

All of which are available for free online in [this link](https://raytracing.github.io/).

My professor's template can be found [here](https://github.com/capagot/RT-Template).
